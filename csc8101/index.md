In today's practical you are going to get some hands-on experience with using Neo4j by writing some Cypher queries.

You will interact with a Neo4j instance running on Microsoft Azure via the Neo4j browser. Open a browser and enter the url: [https://52.151.95.57:7473](https://52.151.95.57:7473).

Login credentials:

* Username: neo4j
* Password: csc8101

Neo4j is loaded with the [Linked Data Benchmark Council](http://ldbcouncil.org) social network dataset. There ~327K nodes and ~1.47M edges, you can view the schema [here](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_snb_datagen).

Before attempting the queries you can familiarize yourself with the Neo4j Browser by executing the command below in the prompt:

{% highlight cypher %}
:play intro
{% endhighlight %}

You can find a quick overview on common Cypher statements by executing:

{% highlight cypher %}
