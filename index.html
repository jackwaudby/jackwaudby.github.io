    <p>I'm a computer science PhD student at <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk"> Newcastle University</a> and are part of the <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/bigdata/">Cloud Computing for Big Data Centre for Doctoral Training</a>.</p>
    <p>My principal research interest is distributed graph databases (specifically, transaction management and replication). Check out my <a href="projects/index.html">projects</a> page for more information about my research.</p>
    <p>My undergraduate and masters degrees were completed at <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk">Lancaster University</a> in Economics & Mathematics and Statistics respectively. </p>
    <p>Outside of my research I enjoy playing football and (for my sins) support Leeds United. I'm also a qualified <a href="https://www.snowpro.com/en/"> CSIA </a> ski instructor and spent most of my time daydreaming about the mountains!
