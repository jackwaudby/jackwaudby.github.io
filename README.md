# My personal website

This repository contains my [personal website](https://jackwaudby.github.io) hosted through GitHub Pages using Jekyll (a static site generator). You can make your own by following this [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). It's a good idea to set up Jekyll [locally](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) so you can edit and preview your site before pushing to github. (So I don't forget) you run jekyll locally using: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
