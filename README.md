# Personal Website

This repository contains my [personal website][https://jackwaudby.github.io].

[Tutorial][http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/]

The website is hosted through GitHub Pages. 

The site is managed through Jekyll a static site generator. 

Jekyll's directory structure:
1. `_site`: generated automatically by Jekyll
2. `_config.yml`: tells Jekyll basics about the project 
3. `_layouts`: main layout that contains repeated elements like `<head>` and `<footer>`

Jekyll uses liquid tags to inject content into the layout. 

Set up Jekyll [locally][https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/] so you can edit and preview your site and then push those changes to your GitHub repo. 

To run locally `bundle exec jekyll serve`
