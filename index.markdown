I'm a Computer Science PhD student at [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk) where I'm part of the [Scalable Computing Group](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/research/groups/scalable/#about) and the [Cloud Computing for Big Data Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/bigdata/).

My main research interest is distributed database systems, specifically transaction management and replication.
My PhD research is concerned with data consistency in distributed graph databases.
I'm also a member of the [Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC)](http://ldbcouncil.org/) Social Network Benchmark Task Force.

My undergraduate and masters degrees were completed at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk) in Economics & Mathematics and Statistics respectively.
Outside of my research I enjoy playing football and I'm also a qualified [CSIA](https://www.snowpro.com/en/) Level 2 ski instructor.
