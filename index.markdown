I'm a Computer Science PhD student at [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk) where I'm part of the
[Scalable Computing Group](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/research/scalable-computing/) and the
[Cloud Computing for Big Data Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/bigdata/). Currently, I'm working as a software engineer in the clustering team at [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/clustering/). 

My main research interest is distributed database systems, specifically transaction management and replication.
My PhD research is concerned with data consistency in distributed graph databases.
I'm also a member of the [Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC)](http://ldbcouncil.org/) Social Network Benchmark Task Force.

My undergraduate and masters degrees were completed at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk) in Economics 
Mathematics and Statistics respectively.
Outside of my research I enjoy playing football and I'm also a qualified [CSIA](https://www.snowpro.com/en/) Level 2 ski instructor. 

I'm also the host of [Disseminate: The Computer Science Research Podcast](https://disseminatepodcast.podcastpage.io/) a podcast featuring interviews with authors of the latest Computer Science papers.
