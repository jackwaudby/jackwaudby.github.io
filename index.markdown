I am a software engineer at [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/clustering/) working in the Clustering Team.

I completed my PhD in Computer Science at [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk) where I was part of the [Scalable Computing Group](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/research/scalable-computing/) and the [Cloud Computing for Big Data Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/bigdata/). 
My main research interest are distributed database systems, specifically the areas of transaction management and replication.
<!-- My PhD research is concerned with data consistency in distributed graph databases. -->
<!-- I'm also a member of the [Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC)](http://ldbcouncil.org/) Social Network Benchmark Task Force. -->

My undergraduate and masters degrees were completed at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk) in Economics &amp; Mathematics and Statistics respectively.
Outside of my research I enjoy running, yoga, and skiing; I'm a qualified [CSIA](https://www.snowpro.com/en/) Level 2 ski instructor. 

I am also the host of [Disseminate: The Computer Science Research Podcast](https://disseminatepodcast.podcastpage.io/) a podcast featuring interviews with authors of the latest Computer Science papers.
