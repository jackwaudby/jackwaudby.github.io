<h2> Newcastle University Systems Reading Group </h2>

<p> I'm the organizer of the bi-weekly Systems Reading Group at Newcastle University. The aim of each meetup is to discuss an influential paper from the computing literature. We have been meeting since early 2018 and I <i><b>always</b></i> lose my notes. So I've decided to document my paper summaries here. Enjoy.. </p>

      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
